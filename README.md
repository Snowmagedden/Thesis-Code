# Thesis-Code
Using deep learning to predict total engagement assessment using videos of interactions between children and the NAO robot. 

The code in this repository closely follows and uses code from Harvey, M. (2019). Five video classification methods. GitHub repository:

For the Conv2D model some excel and notepad needs to be used to manually split the train and test set and to clean the final dataframe to merge properly with results.

For the LSTM model create three folders "train", "test" and "sequences". In addition the videos should in the same folder as the .py files and not in a subfolder.
